- Good class, method, variable names.

- Comments on all classes (not needed inside classes, just on the class level).
    - Comments which are on one line should use the // style. 
    - Comments which are or a couple lines may use either the //, or /* ... */ style.
    - Comments which are many lines long should use /* ... */.

- Inside a class, the fields must be at the top of the class, followed by the methods.

- All strings which end user may see on UI (not LogCat) are in strings.xml.

- All identifiers must have meaningful, human-readable, English names.

- Constants must be all upper case, with multiple words separated by '_'.

- Functions must start with a lower case letter, and use CamelCase. 

- Class names must start with an upper case letter, and use CamelCase. 

- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself!

- Use named constants instead of literal numbers
