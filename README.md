CMPT 276 Fall 2020: Final Project

"Practical Parent" is an Android application developed during the Fall 2020 semester as the group project for CMPT 276.
This app was developed over 3 Scrum sprints wherein group members alternated Scrum roles each sprint.
We used GitLab as our VCS throughout the development of this application and we followed simple object-oriented practices.

This Android app was made to support parents with the practical aspects of raising children. The application will help parents managing timing, deciding who's turn it is, and other issues of critical importance to kids!

Features:
  - Save and configure children info like their names and pictures
  - Flip a virtual coin that keeps track of whose turn it is, as well as the history of all previous coin flip results
  - Simple meditation with animations and sounds 
  - Timer that can be used for many things - has all standard timer features as well as an animation that plays along with the timer
